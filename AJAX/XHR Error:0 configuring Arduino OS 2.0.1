Greetings ,
I have been directed over from Arduino bug report by facchinm.  
My Yun is running Arduino OS Version 2.0.1-arduino-os. 
The OS.js project is by Anders Evenrud.
I am encountering an error AJAX/XHR Error:0 during configuration that does not allow the process to complete.
The steps of configuring the Yun begin with a factory reset of 30 seconds of wlan reset button 
(ensuring that the blue led is flashing the whole time). 
Then connect my laptop wifi to the Yun and open 192.168.240.1 with psswd "arduino". 
The Arduino Configuration Wizard opens with a dialog box that looks different from all the multiple demos online. 
But the same user data is required. Here Luci is available with a few clicks. 
Once user data is input then the Save and Restart button is clicked. 
Little warning announcements are displayed "Warning: Off-line" then an AJAX/XHR Error:0 is displayed. 
Sometimes the Wizard self connects the laptop back on to the network, 
but sometimes the Wizard asks for the user to reconnect to the network (I have reset this many times). 
Then when trying to sign back on to 192.168.240.1 with any psswd an AJAX/XHR Error:0 is produced. 
The Yun does not join the network but the laptop does wifi connect through the sketch. 
I picked up the Yun from Sparkfun and couple of days ago and was told that it was loaded with the latest OS. 
All wifi devices are within 18 inches of each other and the signal strength is 100%.
Thanks for your help!
